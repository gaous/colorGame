# colorGame
A fun project where you need to identify and choose which tile has the correct color by looking at the values of R(red), G(green) and B(blue).
If you choose the wrong one, it will fade away. But, if you choose the correct one and win, all the tiles will get the same color as the correct one. You also have easy and hard mode to play.
